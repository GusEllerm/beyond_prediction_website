Prediction: Live and Transparent Data Science </h2>
<p>Our strategic direction focuses on developing new data science
methods that actually improve the conduct of research, and to
demonstrate some of these improvements in the life science,
specifically: genomics, population health and ecology. We provide a
high-level summary of our work towards these strategic directions
below.</p>
<p>Our <strong><em>Live Data Science</em></strong> initiative aims at
<strong>closing the gap between the ‘doing’ of science and the
‘publishing’ of science</strong>, and in doing so also make it easier
and more transparent to report and share research findings. In an era
when data are ubiquitous and regularly updated, the lag in writing and
publishing science—whether in academic journals or in reports for the
government—becomes restrictive and is a source of great
inefficiency.</p>
<p>Our <strong>Transparent Data Science</strong> initiative concentrates
on the challenge of improving the trustworthiness and reproducibility of
data-intensive research, providing tools to question scientific claims
and query research processes. This opens up research to more scrutiny,
which helps to improve trust, and offers new avenues for public
engagement.</p>
<p>Our <strong>Applications of Data Science in the Life
Sciences</strong> tackles a multitude of longstanding analytical
challenges and problems in genomics, ecology and population health,
including: (i) new techniques to improve the accuracy of phylodynamic
modeling, with applications into infectious diseases, (ii) modelling the
entire genone of a species and using this to anticipate adaptation
capacity to a changing environment (iii) understanding the complex
relationships between population genomics and common illnesses, to
better target health interventions and (iv) better understanding and
thus ability to control the spread of infectious diseases through
susceptible populations.</p>
<p><em>The <strong>extremely rapid advancement of Generative Artificial
Intelligence (GenAI)</strong> has created many new opportunities in
science, both in the sense of improving productivity with more generic
(desktop) AI assistants, and providing entirely new ways to solve very
complex science questions. <strong>This re-orientation of science and AI
is a major driver of some of our activities for 2025-6</strong>, as
shown in the sections below.</em></p>
<p><em>Our overall focus remains on <strong>translating progress in data
science and AI into new tools and workflows that can provide advantage
in areas that matter for New Zealand</strong>, as we balance our support
for primary industries with our need to provide a sustainable and
healthy ecosystem to support them. The report below describes our
planned work in genomics, biological science, population health and
ecology, empowered by our research into explainable and transparent data
science.</em></p></td>

<p>In the coming year, our <strong>Explainable Data Science</strong>
team will be conducting a mechanistic analysis of LLM model
distillation. Knowledge distillation compresses large language models
(LLMs) into smaller, more efficient versions by training a student model
with fewer parameters to mimic the outputs of a larger teacher model,
while maintaining comparable performance. This leads to benefits in
terms of computation, memory, and speed leading to wider adoption and
utility of models, meaning that the same model can be run reliably on a
much smaller computational platform. This implies bigger impacts for New
Zealand for high-stakes applications, such as LLMs for genomics,
materials science, climate science and drug discovery that can be run
locally, on modest computational infrastructure. However, the underlying
transformations that occur remain poorly understood. The focus in this
year will be on the impact on a model's internal circuits,
representations spaces, and activation patterns.</p>
<p>The research questions we will be pursuing include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How significantly does the distillation process alter the
underlying internal representations and learned algorithms?</p></li>
<li><p>What effect does distillation have on a model's
robustness?</p></li>
<li><p>How can an alignment metric best quantify structural and
functional differences between a teacher and a student model?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By providing a mechanistic understanding of the changes that take
place during knowledge distillation, we aim to improve trust in LLMs
used for science. It will also help in designing more effective student
models and mitigating potential failure cases.</p>
<p>The 2025-2026 phase of our <em>LivePublication</em> project (see
previous reports) applies the now matured workflow to case study
applications, engaging in cross-disciplinary research opportunities.
<em>LivePublication</em> bridges the gap between computational research
and scholarly communication through FAIR-compliant, automated, and
reproducible publication systems for entire scientific experiments. A
major goal of the work for the coming year is piloting
<em>LivePublication</em> implementations with local researchers and
institutions. Potential impacts here are large, such as improving the
effectiveness and reliability of science, and ensuring that all the
relevant details of computationally-led research are recorded,
communicated and preserved.</p>
<p>In the coming year for our <strong>biodiversity and ecology</strong>
team, research fellow William Pearman will complete a second,
significant piece of work using simulations to assess the ability of the
microbiome - the resident microbes in and on a host - to buffer
environmental changes experience by the host. William's work in the past
year has illustrated that for hosts with limited genetic diversity the
microbiome is an important buffer that enables hosts to persist in
otherwise unsuitable environments, but that there is some potential for
'conflict' – that which is good for the microbes to persist is not
necessarily good for the host persistence. In the coming year we will
build further complexity into this model to assess both cooperation and
conflict for hosts with more genetic diversity - when, as a host, does
it make sense to rely more on your microbiome, and can this reliance be
reversed if environmental conditions become more benign? </p>
<p>Our <strong>Genomics Data Science</strong> continue work on improving
the data analytics of genomics data. Particularly focussing on elements
involving distinguishing genuine and useful biological signals and from
biological and experimental noise. Better understanding of the errors
and uncertainties of genomics data is of strategic importance to many
industries in New Zealand, as we work to maximise the effectiveness and
minimise the side-effects of commercial agriculture.</p>
<p>Our research will focus on advancing Bayesian phylogenetic methods
through three complementary projects in the coming year. The first
project will evaluate Bayesian inference performance on single-cell DNA
sequencing tumour data using BEAST2, addressing the lack of realistic
simulation tools in this field. The second will implement calibrated
coalescent point process (CPP) models within <em>LinguaPhylo</em> to
support well-calibrated evolutionary studies. The third will develop a
comprehensive Bayesian phylogenetic model averaging framework using
Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo models (RJMCMC) to account for
model uncertainty rather than relying on single models. Together, these
projects aim to significantly improve the accuracy, reproducibility, and
computational efficiency of evolutionary analyses in biological
research.</p>
<h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>
<p>The <strong>Explainable Data Science</strong> team will be presenting
KEA Explain, a new framework we developed for creating explanations of
LLM hallucinations using graph kernel analysis, at the 19th
International Conference on Neurosymbolic Learning and Reasoning in
September 2025. We are also preparing a submission on the mechanistic
analysis of distillation for <em>NeurIPS</em> (the #1 AI conference
world-wide).</p>
<p>As <em>LivePublication</em> pilots come online, there are
opportunities to explore how generative technologies (LLMs) can
integrate and augment academic research articles. This speaks to the
broader research topic of explainable AI (XAI), and the use of LLMs
within context-critical domains – e.g. domains where accurate and
transparent generation are required. Further, integrations and
developments with project partner Stencila, offer high value
opportunities in lowering the barrier to deploying
<em>LivePublication</em> instances for researchers, and deriving more
value through dynamic narrative systems outline the core research
horizons for this year.</p>
<p>The deployment of <em>LivePublication</em> pilots will support
real-world research projects – showcasing how <em>LivePublication</em>
can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Improve timely and accurate representations of ongoing
research</p></li>
<li><p>Enable auditable transparency for environmental and other
computational research</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce barriers to understanding and communicating research
findings</p></li>
<li><p>Exploit synergies between LivePublication and New Zealand’s
national science challenges – sustainable land use, climate resilience –
offering high value opportunities to explore transparent publication
mechanisms and science communication in areas where the impact to New
Zealand could be high.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In our work on using AI to augment science reporting, we will to
continue our work on making AI instructions first class members of a
document such that they can be rerun periodically (e.g. when data is
updated). We will operalize our existing framework for AI instruction
using tools such as <em>GithubActions</em> and the <em>Ghost Content
Management System</em> to allow researchers to create regularly updating
documents. We will improve, and expand upon, our existing integrations
with <em>Electronic Lab Notebooks</em>, <em>Microsoft Word,</em> and
tools such as <em>Notion</em>. This will allow these formats to be: (a)
used as ingestion sources for GraphRAG databases, (b) output and
collaboration formats for users less familiar with <em>Markdown</em>
and/or <em>LaTeX</em> for authoring research articles and
reports<em>.</em></p>
<p>Our work on exploring and understanding attribution of scientific
ideas will contribute to improving the understanding of research and the
ease by which attribution claims for ideas can be queried and
resolved—an important aspect in the successful establishment of
Intellectual Property (IP) and patents. The attribution tool and
reviewer workflow will support a more effective evaluation of research
and the prior art that it draws from..</p>
<p>Our work in the <strong>biodiversity and ecology</strong> space will
leverage both empirical and simulated data to develop new methods and
approaches that enable us to understand the ability of species to adapt
to their rapidly changing environment. These tools and approaches
therefore have direct application to our ability to assess both the
ability of threatened species to adapt and potentially 'rebound' from
the brink of extinction, and the potential of invasive species to
continue to expand their range, and hence economic, ecosystem and health
impacts that are key to both sustainability and agricultural goals. </p>
<p>Our <strong>Genomics Data Science</strong> will deliver substantial
scientific benefits through multiple pathways. The simulation study will
enhance evolutionary reconstruction accuracy in cancer research by
providing a realistic pipeline for evaluating variant callers and
inference models. The calibrated coalescent point process (CPP)
implementation will improve evolutionary timescale estimation by
allowing researchers to control important calibration points. The RJMCMC
(Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo) framework will enable more
reliable phylogenetic trees through model averaging. We anticipate
multiple high-impact publications and the release of open-source
software tools that will benefit fields including conservation genetics,
epidemiology, and cancer evolution, and an commensurate improvement in
the reliability of predictive models in genomics.</p>
<h2 id="excellence-science-excellence">Excellence (Science
excellence)</h2>
<p>Three high impact research projects are under development with our
<strong>Genomics Data Science</strong> team. In brief, one explores the
evidence supporting functional human genes, a second deploys a model
based on this evidence to confirm and identify novel functional human
genes. A third project will assess the impact of RNA structure on RNA
turnover, this is a topical area due to the development of computational
tools for RNA vaccine design. All projects will target high-impact
venues in natural language processing and AI (e.g., ACL, ACM, EMNLP).
Each integrates state-of-the-art techniques, rigorous empirical
evaluation, and interdisciplinary relevance.</p>
<p>Our projects represent cutting-edge research in computational
biology. The calibrated CPP development provides a general solution to a
long-standing problem, significantly expanding the application of
accurate calibration to birth-death models in phylogenetics. The RJMCMC
project pioneers a comprehensive model-averaging approach validated
through extensive simulations and case studies. All projects aim for
publication in high-impact journals in evolutionary biology and
computational biology, with presentations at international conferences
including SMBE 2025 Beijing (July 20-24) planned to demonstrate
scientific excellence and gather expert feedback.</p>
<p>Our <strong>Data Science in Biodiversity &amp; Ecology</strong> team
will continue to build on our innovative approaches to measure genetic
diversity and infer adaptability over time and space, while ensuring our
work is open source and reproducible. In the past year, we have
generated whole genome sequences for a further 200 hihi (stitchbird)
individuals, taking our total number sequenced to over 450 individuals
of this threatened, <em>taonga</em> species. We have utilised highly
accurate genome sequences from a reference set of 30 individuals to
'fill the gaps' of missing genetic data from the lower-cost sequencing
of the 450 individuals. This has enabled genome-wide diversity estimates
and revealed considerable variation between individuals in their genetic
diversity. Crucially, with this data now in hand, in the coming year we
will be linking this genetic diversity data to individual fitness
(measured as the number of offspring a bird has over its lifetime), with
the hypothesis that genetically diverse individuals are more resilient,
live longer and have more opportunities for reproduction than low
diversity individuals. This will be one of the most comprehensive
assessments ever of the relationship between genetic diversity and
individual health for a threatened species. Our code and workflow will
be available on <em>github</em> and available to others in the community
to complete a genetic health assessment of other threatened species.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the coming year, research fellow William Pearman will complete
a second, significant piece of work using simulations to assess the
ability of the microbiome - the resident microbes in and on a host - to
buffer environmental changes experience by the host. William's work in
the past year has illustrated that for hosts with limited genetic
diversity the microbiome is an important buffer that enables hosts to
persist in otherwise unsuitable environments, but that there is some
potential for 'conflict' – that which is good for the microbes to
persist is not necessarily good for the host persistence. In the coming
year we will build further complexity into this model to assess both
cooperation and conflict for hosts with more genetic diversity - when,
as a host, does it make sense to rely more on your microbiome, and can
this reliance be reversed if environmental conditions become more
benign? </p></li>
<li><p>Kamolphat has already completed work illustrating the 'missing
story' when utilising only a snapshot of the genome to assess
adaptation, and that whole-genome sequence is much more powerful and
accurate in detecting adaptive 'signals of selection' in the genome. In
the coming year, we will build a model to simulate the impact of
sequential bottlenecks (i.e., heavily reduced population sizes) on
detecting these signals of selection. These bottlenecks are common to
both threatened species and invasive species where just a few
individuals may be transported and establish a new population. </p></li>
</ul>
<p>In <strong>Transparent Data Science</strong> we will publish
peer-reviewed papers on the <em>LivePublication</em> platform,
highlighting provenance modelling and implementation strategies.
<em>LivePublication</em> pilots will be hosted on open platforms to
provide value in their format. There are ongoing conversations regarding
how these publications interface with traditional publication venues,
and some interest from more traditional publishers in experimenting with
our new approach.  Our work is contributing to the development of
international standards in three important areas of open science: (i)
scientific workflows, (ii) representing provenance and (iii)
containerisation of research objects (RO-Crate), demonstrating value
within the international research community. </p>
<p>With our commercial partner, <em>Stencila</em>, we will also be
working on richer representations of research experiments and their
translation into research articles. The approach we shall be pioneering
over the coming year uses domain-specific <em>Multimodel GraphRAG</em>
databases in this regard to improve the accuracy of AI-based methods to
help generate, or evaluate, research products such as reports, computer
programs, scripts and workflows. GraphRAG is a new field where knowledge
graphs are used to help with AI Retrieval Augmented Generation; the
GraphRAG process involves creating a knowledge graph out of raw text, or
other information sources then building a graph of community knowledge,
generating summaries for a community, and then leveraging these
structures when perform RAG-based tasks, such as automated text or code
generation. Using our existing document converters were are able to
chunk documents into structurally and semantically meaningful document
"nodes" (e.g. paragraphs, table and figure captions, images, equations),
not just chunks of text as in naive RAG. We canonicalize identifiers
within documents using the OpenAlex API: DOIs for articles and the
references they cite, ORCIDs for researchers, and ROR for research
organizations. In addition, we use LLMs to perform named entity
recognition on the content of a document (e.g. identify mention of gene
or proteins within a table caption. These document nodes are stored in a
graph database which allows precise retrieval of context based on the
user's query and/or the content of the document that they are currently
authoring. For example, retrieving all tables where a specific gene was
mentioned in the caption in articles written after a specific date.</p>
<p>We will be embedding models specific to particular domains (e.g.
PubMedBERT) to also add vector search capabilities to the graph
database. We are developing a simple language, DocsSQL to make querying
of these databases more intuitive, and less error prone for both humans
and AI agentic systems.</p>
<h2 id="research-horizons-horizons-and-co-fundingleverage">Research
Horizons (Horizons and co-funding/leverage)</h2>
<p>Our foundational data science projects pave the way for applied
research proposals in Europe and the USA, including potential
MBIE/Endeavour opportunities involving containerisation of research
objects (where keen interest already exists in the EU and in Australia).
We also anticipate collaborations with digital infrastructure providers
(such as <em>Globus</em>) and academic publishers committed to
transparent science.</p>
<p>Our work with the <em>Allen AI institute</em> has already resulted in
co-funding of research staff, and we hope to extend this in 2025 to
include a similar connection with <em>Microsoft AI</em>.</p>
<p>Our genomics projects open several exciting research horizons. The
simulation and variant calling pipelines could be extended to develop AI
models generating realistic DNA sequences along phylogenetic trees. The
RJMCMC framework can be expanded to additional model dimensions and
tested on whole-genome datasets. Collectively, our work combines
Bayesian statistics, tree combinatorics, algorithm design, and
phylogenetics, with potential applications in real-time outbreak
analysis and large-scale evolutionary studies.</p>
<h2 id="capability-development-investing-in-people">Capability
Development (Investing in people)</h2>
<p><strong>Our Team</strong></p>
<p>In 2025 we welcomed Reilly Haskins and Andrew Probert, two new PhD
students working in the Explainable Data Science theme. Reilly is an
example of our commitment to train new researchers at the PhD level in
New Zealand who have expertise to contribute to the fundamentals of LLM
research. Andrew already has a PhD in mathematics, and is seeking
another in AI.</p>
<p>We have starting off two new PhD students into the Genomics team led
by Alexei Drummond, making a team of three. Working on the genomics
models outlined above, three PhD students (Yuan Xu, Eva Li and Sophie
Yang) will develop skills in Bayesian phylogenetics, model building,
validation, programming, and data analysis,. These students will attend
international conferences (including SMBE 2025 in Beijing) and workshops
to present findings and refine skills, with knowledge sharing occurring
through mentorship opportunities. This investment in people will
strengthen New Zealand's capability in computational biology, Bayesian
computation, and statistical modelling, all of which are needed as we
look to future opportunities.</p>
<p>The Transparent Data Science team is also about to welcome a new
student led by Mark Gahegan. These will be the last PhD students we
add.</p>
<p>Two PhD students (Daniella Schiavinato and Estefania Rojas Lopez) are
making good progress on their research projects. An ARF continues to
develop robust research and analytical skills for analyzing large-scale
genomics datasets.   </p>
<p>Research fellow William Pearman has secured a four year Future Leader
Mana Tūāpapa fellowship from the Royal Society of New Zealand. The focus
of the fellowship builds on the expertise he has gained in simulating
host-microbiome coevolution. William will continue 0.2 as a research
fellow in the Beyond Prediction project, with the remainder dedicated to
his Mana Tūāpapa project. This joint position will give him the
opportunity to be closely mentored by the Beyond Prediction team,
particularly in project management and supervisory skills, as he builds
towards full research independence.</p>
<p>New research fellow Kamolphat Atsawawaranunt has been added. We are
also supporting Kamolphat in his career development as he transitions
from an externally funded PhD position at University of Auckland to his
new role as Research fellow. Kamolphat will have the opportunity to
co-supervise postgraduate students and is taking a more active role in
designing his project based on the expertise he developed during his
PhD.</p>
<p>Finally, Hui Zhen Tan is now in the final year of her PhD. She has
just been selected to present a talk at the highly competitive annual
Society for Molecular Biology meeting, to be held in Beijing in July.
Given its location in Asia for the first time since 2017, we are
anticipating a strong attendance from researchers in the Asia-Pacific
region, which will give Hui Zhen valuable networking opportunities to
enable her to secure a position and funding to return home to Singapore
(and will give the New Zealand Data Science team a new collaborative
link into this region). </p>
<p><strong>Beyond Our Team</strong></p>

<h2 id="vision-mātauranga">Vision Mātauranga</h2>
<p>PI Phil Wilcox and team will be developing additional tools to help
us better understand how different diseases disproportionately impact
the Māori community.</p>
<p>Our research connects to Vision Mātauranga principles, particularly
through our focus on colorectal cancer, which has a high incidence among
Māori. Understanding the evolutionary history of cancers may contribute
to earlier diagnosis and improved treatment outcomes for Māori and other
New Zealand populations. When analyses involve taonga species, we will
consult with iwi and hapū to ensure respect for mātauranga Māori and
data sovereignty. We also plan to share findings through the
university's Māori science network, making our work accessible to Māori
communities and students.</p>
<p>Extending beyond data, we are exploring the responsible framing and
attribution of indigenous knowledge in scientific literature and in
scientific models, ensuring our models reflect ethical and culturally
appropriate practices.</p>
<p>We continue to build on and support successes of internship programme
for Māori students, led by Lara Greaves, and we will be offering this
opportunity again this year. One of the students from the previous
summer scholarship programme (Tori) is now a PhD student with us. Two
others (Ben) and Eric) are now enrolled in Masters degrees. The
remaining student (Piki) is about to begin post-graduate studies. We
will continue to offer guidance to this cohort over the coming year as
they navigate academia.</p>
<p>Lara Greaves is also editing a special issue of the Journal of the
Royal society of New Zealand on Māori data sovereignty – and we shall be
working on ways to disseminate these case studies to Māori communities.
Lara will also be helping to design the <em>Te Mana Raraunga</em> /
(data sovereignty) website (https://www.temanararaunga.maori.nz/ )and
creating resource banks for communities to use.</p>

and Partnerships (Domestic and international collaboration)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>In addition to existing collaborations with the <em>Allen
Institute for AI</em>, we now also have a research connection into
<em>Microsoft AI,</em> that we will be developing over the coming
year.</p></li>
<li><p>We will be aligning some of our projects with the newly refunded
Genomics Aotearoa, and potentially proposing new projects, once the call
for these comes out later in 2025.</p></li>
<li><p>Our genomics work involves multiple international collaborations,
including with Professor David Posada's group at the University of Vigo
(Spain), Professor Tanja Stadler at ETH Zürich (Switzerland), and
experts in Bayesian phylogenetics (Dr Remco Bouckaert) for integration
with the BEAST2 software. We are also developing domestic partnerships
for applying our methods to New Zealand species data, linking
theoretical advances to practical biodiversity management. These
collaborative relationships enhance knowledge exchange and amplify our
research impact.</p></li>
<li><p>In the coming year the we will maintain our strong links to the
<em>Hihi Recovery Group</em> and its members, which include
international collaborators Dr John Ewen and Dr Patricia Brekke, both
research fellows at the Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of
London.  </p></li>
<li><p>We will continue our collaboration with the Globus group led by
Prof. Ian Foster at Argonne nat. labs, USA. We have developed
provenance-racking additions to the Globus Flows toolkit and will be
sharing these back with our Globus collaborators. We meet with the
Globus Flows team periodically</p></li>
<li><p>Continued and direct collaboration with Stencila. We have been
working on evaluating new Stencila’s features, and where appropriate
aligning those features with LivePublication functions.</p></li>
<li><p>PIs Gahegan and Witbrock and post-doc Tan are now actively
participating in the Trillion Parameters Consortium (TPC: <a
href="https://www.anl.gov/cels/trillion-parameter-consortium">https://www.anl.gov/cels/trillion-parameter-consortium</a>)
TPC is an international consortium of over 1,500 AI researchers working
together on research to help make AI more effective for science
(AI4Sci).</p></li>
<li><p>PIs Paul Gardner &amp; Alex Gavryushkin have been elected leaders
for a pillar of the recently initiated RNA Platform (looking at
selecting targets for vaccines or therapeutics). Gardner is also
involved with an additional pillar looking at designing therapeutic
RNAs.</p></li>

id="support-for-nationally-significant-databases-and-collections">Support
for Nationally Significant Databases and Collections</h2>
<p>While no direct monetary support has been provided to nationally
significant databases, our projects contribute indirectly by enhancing
the value of biological datasets through more robust and scalable
analyses. We plan to make all genetic sequence data, phylogenetic trees,
and software tools openly available through public repositories such as
GenBank, TreeBASE, and GitHub, aligning with national efforts to build
enduring digital research assets and supporting the effective use of
genomic databases critical to New Zealand's research ecosystem.</p></td>
