<p>Against the ‘Strategic Intent’ section in your Programme Plan, briefly outline any internal or external drivers that have influenced your SSIF plans for the coming year. Comment on any changes in key drivers of your SSIF investment, and explain how you will respond to these.</p><p>Suggested word limit: <strong>500 words</strong></p><p><strong>External drivers</strong></p><p>The ability to recruit both PhD students and post-doctoral researchers has of course been drastically curtailed due to the COVID19 pandemic and related, ongoing border closure. Data Science researchers are thin on the ground in NZ, and we had planned to recruit widely from overseas data science programmes that are ahead of our own, to build up our national capability. We have need to change plans of course and concentrate on growing local talent through our related Masters programs, and via returning NZ scientists. The border situation seems likely to continue through to 2022, since the low numbers of PhD students admitted this year (500 so far for the whole of NZ) have been prioritised towards those retiring to finish their degree, rather than those starting their degree.</p><p>We have managed to fill some of our positions, but not all of them. In all cases so far we are able to simply compress the work into the remaining years. However, should the situation significantly impact 2022 as well, we may reach the point where we need to reduce our planned activities, because we have some dependencies that will start to complicate delivery of some of the latter tasks (specifically, the planned Live Data Science Journal Workflow). We are not concerned about this yet, just flagging a potential issue for the future.</p><p>One possible change to the strategic drivers involves viral and other (future) outbreak preparedness. From the data science perspective, one of the challenges brought by the pandemic is to rapidly integrate new data/ evidence to update the inference result/ forecast. We've seen this with the genomic sequencing data that was being released in batches and required to redo various epidemiological analyses. This slowed down the most accurate methods significantly enough to favour much less accurate but more computationally efficient heuristics. This can be addressed by developing online approaches to genomic data analysis.</p><p><strong>Internal Drivers</strong></p><p>Our restricted ability to recruit internationally is leading us to focus more on cultivating our own PhD students in Data Science. The new Data Science masters programmes at our relevant institutions, as well as our existing Computer Science programmes is providing us with opportunities.</p><p>Also see note below on opportunities relating to <em>Māori Data Sovereignty.</em></p>

<p>Total suggested word limit: <strong>750 words</strong></p><p><strong>Planned Focus for the coming year</strong></p><p><strong>The</strong> <strong>Meta Data Science</strong> team will add a post-doc at UoA whose work will focus on integrating the different semantic annotation and scraping techniques being pioneered by our team members Prof. Sebastian Link at UoA and Dr. Ben Adams at UC into a single, common system that will be used to improve the automated semantic integration for Live Data. This is turn will increase impact as the resulting tools will be made available to other researchers. Timeframe for completion is two years, though by the end of the next reporting period we expect to be able to demonstrate, and use, some automated ingest and schema production methods, for use by our application teams (‘omics and biodiversity modelling) to allow the rapid acquisition of new data.</p><p><strong>Explainable Data Science</strong> adds a second PhD student at UoA to study the semantics of scientific descriptions and the connections between algorithmic and textural descriptions of methods and workflows. This will add to our capability on AI reasoning to bridge the gap between methods and explanations in science, which will allow us to begin to automatically annotate and describe scientific workflows, eventually building towards the ‘live’ data science where research articles become living documents that respond to changes in data, methods, results, etc.</p><p><strong>Live Data Science</strong> We have recently begun working on identifying those methods that can be adapted to the continuous integration scenario, that is, when the algorithm doesn't terminate after results are produced, but enters a ‘wait state’ for the introduction of new data that is then integrated "on the fly” (see above) and triggers recalculation of the results and then potentially leads to a re-interpretation of the conclusions. This work involves teams at both Auckland and Otago who are working closely together and are in regular contact, including visits and coordination of PhD student activities.</p><p><strong>Modelling Biodiversity</strong> will also add an additional PhD student to work on integration of biodiversity methods with some of our progress in Live Data Science. In other words, helping to create biodiversity models that can be immediately responsive to any change event resulting in new incoming data. This will help improve our biodiversity resilience and forecasting.</p><p><strong>Excellence</strong></p><p>We expect to continue publishing our research over the next 12 months, aiming for 10 additional peer-reviewed publications, including one paper on surveying existing methods for grounding explanations in domain theory, and deriving such explanations by automated means.</p><p>As soon as practical, we will begin to bring experts from our collaborating institutes overseas to NZ, and sending our researchers and PhD students out for visits, so that we build first-hand and in-depth experience of best international practice in Data Science.</p><p><strong>Impact</strong></p><p>Provided there are no further long lockdowns, we will be offering a Research Bazaar targeted at helping our younger researchers to adapt to the opportunities afforded by data science, including the use of deep learning and AI, and on Māori Data Sovereignty. We had planned to offer our first Research Bazaar in 2020, but various lockdowns, particularly in Auckland, made that infeasible for us. The Bazaar will be open to all NZ researchers, free to attend, and will help lift our collective capability more broadly as a science community.</p><p>We have the opportunity to apply some of our nascent automation methods to the workflows involved in sequencing the virus variants associated with our COVID19 cases (see above), which we will endeavor to take as this will help improve pandemic outcomes for the wider NZ population.</p><p><strong>New Opportunities for the coming year</strong></p><p>The Genomic research team led by Dr. Alex Gavryushkin has been exploring attention-based learning approaches (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03820"><u>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03820</u></a>) to genomics with the Computer Scientist team in Auckland. As recently been shown by Google, Facebook, and others, this is a massively promising direction. We've designed a specific biomedical project aimed at NZ, including Māori and Pacifica populations, to exploit this opportunity and we plan to focus on it for the coming year then re-assess. We will involve our Māori researchers in this project to ensure we adopt a culturally-sensitive approach. The team involved are meeting in Auckland next week to finalize staffing needs which will then be presented to the leadership team for review. This opportunity is strong, and has appeared since we wrote the proposal. We believe this offers a unique opportunity for NZ to develop our talent in an emerging and promising area of AI.</p><p>Another change in strategic direction we are currently exploring is the development of domain-specific languages for computational biology and biological data science, using mature language engineering frameworks such as <em>Xtext</em> (<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/"><u>https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/</u></a></p><p>XText is a framework for the development of domain-specific programming languages, allowing researchers to create and validate new grammatical constructs for modelling that better suit their analytical tasks. The ‘distance’ between the constructs in a modelling or analytics language and those used in a domain (such as genomics) can create both a semantic ‘friction’ for the researcher and also lead to computational inefficiencies that become limiting with complex problems. Creating modelling languages that better align with a specific science domain seems to offer a new way forward here. We had planned to simply extend our current work to provide the domain methods needed for our Disease Modelling, Biodiversity Modelling, and Omics Modelling, but we now believe this offers a more compelling and effective way forward. This change will help to give NZ a real research advantage if we can build capability in this exciting &amp; emerging area.</p><ol>  <li><strong>Modelling ‘Omics’ Data</strong></li>  <li><strong>Developing better Modelling Languages</strong> <strong>(for Disease, Biodiversity &amp; Omics Modelling)</strong></li>  <li><strong>Pandemic Preparedness</strong></li></ol>

<h3 id="section-4-risks-issues-and-opportunities">Section 4: Risks, Issues and Opportunities </h3>

<p>Briefly describe the key risks, issues or opportunities that influenced your planning for 2021/22.</p><p>For each detail:</p><p>What it is</p><p>How it has been identified</p><p>How you will mitigate the risk/issue or realise the opportunity</p><p>Where relevant, this should include an assessment of sensitive technologies and how you will address any risks.</p><p>Suggested word limit: <strong>300 words</strong></p><p>The main risk is the continued delay in recruiting from overseas but the opportunity is that some of the local talent might stay in NZ. One of our main strategic aims is to increase the Data Science capability in the country, and one of the most effective ways to do this is by importing talented post-doctoral researchers from elsewhere. At this stage we would rather delay some of our planned work (as noted above) until such a time as recruiting from overseas becomes feasible again. This will likely have implications for budget rollover from 2021 into 2022. We will review this stance at the start of 2022, since cannot compress our schedule indefinitely.</p><p>Another risk we face is that many of our researchers are directly involved in pandemic response work, and in some cases have even been seconded to the national COVID19 response. This impacted us significantly in 2020, though has not so far in 2021.</p><p>One opportunity, related to staff shortage, is to redirect existing members of our research groups to this grant, allowing us to keep our teams together for longer. One example is the senior research fellow (Dr. Remco Bouckaert) from Alexei Drummond’s group who is already working on the idea of online algorithms that would be a great fit with our Live Data Science theme.</p><p>Another opportunity is that UoA is now actively committed to becoming a recognised <em>Māori Data Sovereignty (MDS)</em> organisation—that is, an institution where all research data is managed according to MDS principles. Prof. Gahegan (PI) is involved in coordinating this work at the institution. This creates an opportunity for our Platform to also adopt the same principles, which will result in a better cultural understanding of data amongst our team and more careful data management for any data that is culturally sensitive. An institutional Data Maturity Framework emphasising MDS has been created to support this work, which we believe we can also adopt. The exposure will help us create a team of researchers more in touch with the principles of Vision Mātauranga.</p>
