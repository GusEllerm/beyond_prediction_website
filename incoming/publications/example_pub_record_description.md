## About This Publication

This publication was presented at the IEEE e-Science 2023 conference and introduces the concept of "LivePublication" - an innovative approach where the scientific workflow itself creates and updates the publication. This represents a paradigm shift from traditional static publications to dynamic, workflow-integrated scholarly outputs.
