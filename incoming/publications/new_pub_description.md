- Gus Ellerm's publication list
- Mark Gahegan's publication list  
- Ben Adams' publication list

### Publication Significance

This publication is **highly relevant to the Beyond Prediction project** as it represents foundational work on "livepublication" - a core concept where computational workflows directly drive and update scientific articles. This aligns perfectly with the project's vision of dynamic, reproducible, and machine-actionable research outputs.

From Gus Ellerm's bio on the site:
> "Gus Ellerm is a computer scientist whose research centres on research workflows, provenance and live scientific publications... he is lead author of the 'Enabling LivePublication' and 'LivePublication: The Science Workflow Creates and Updates the Publication' papers, which prototype systems where computational workflows directly drive and update scientific articles."

### Content Summary

The publication presents a system where:
- Science workflows automatically create and update publications
- Research outputs are dynamic rather than static
- Computational processes are integrated with the publication lifecycle
- Publications can evolve as the underlying research and data change

This represents an innovative approach to scientific publishing that supports reproducibility, transparency, and automated updating of research findings.

### BibTeX Format
The dropped file contains the publication in BibTeX format:
```bibtex
@inproceedings{ellerm2023livepublication,
  title={Livepublication: The science workflow creates and updates the publication},
  author={Ellerm, Augustus and Gahegan, Mark and Adams, Benjamin},
  booktitle={2023 IEEE 19th International Conference on e-Science (e-Science)},
  pages={1--10},
  year={2023},
  organization={IEEE}
}
```

## Actions Taken
- ✅ Examined the dropped BibTeX file
- ✅ Identified all three authors as Beyond Prediction team members
- ✅ Confirmed publication already exists in database
- ✅ Documented publication metadata and significance
- ✅ No additional import action needed (already in system)

## Conclusion
The dropped publication is a key work by three Beyond Prediction team members on "livepublication" systems. It is already properly integrated into the website's publications database and appears on the relevant author pages. No further action is required for integration.
