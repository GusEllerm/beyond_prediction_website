## Publication Summary

This paper presents the LivePublication framework, which fundamentally reimagines how scientific publications work in the digital age. Instead of treating research articles as static PDF documents that become outdated as soon as they're published, LivePublication transforms them into living, dynamic components of an active computational research system.

### Key Innovations:

1. **Living Documents:** The framework keeps research papers synchronized with their underlying data, code, and computational workflows, allowing them to update automatically as new results become available.

2. **Three-Part Architecture:**
   - **Experiment Infrastructure:** Handles data acquisition and workflow execution
   - **Interface Layer:** Packages outputs into portable research objects (using RO-Crate)
   - **LivePaper:** A web-based dynamic publication that updates its figures and text based on new computations

3. **Research Object Integration:** The system uses RO-Crate containers to bundle computational contexts with the resulting articles, ensuring reproducibility and transparency.

4. **Version Control:** Maintains citation stability while allowing the content to evolve, addressing the tension between traditional scholarly publishing requirements and modern computational research practices.

### Significance:

This work bridges traditional academic publishing with modern computational research practices, addressing critical issues around:
- Reproducibility in computational science
- Long-term utility of research outputs
- Connection between static publications and evolving computational environments
- FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) research principles

The paper demonstrates these concepts through practical case studies, including experiments with Sentinel-2 satellite data and language identification tasks, showing how the framework can automatically regenerate figures, metrics, and method descriptions as workflows execute.

## Authors in Repository

All three authors are members of the Beyond Prediction consortium:

- **Augustus Ellerm** (Gus Ellerm): Primary developer and lead author
- **Mark Gahegan**: Consortium member (ORCID: 0000-0001-7209-8156)
- **Benjamin Adams** (Ben Adams): Consortium member (ORCID: 0000-0002-1657-9809)

## Recommended Action

Since this publication already exists in the repository and is properly cross-referenced with:
- The Live Research Articles project
- All three author profiles
- Proper metadata including DOI, OpenAlex ID, and author information

**No further action is required** beyond acknowledging the drop and potentially removing the dropped BibTeX file from the incoming directory once processed.

The BibTeX format in the dropped file matches the existing publication data, confirming that this is the same work already in the system.
